# Bayesian-Methods-for-Machine-Learning
The notebooks cover some important topics in Bayesian Methhods in maching learning such as GMM, EM, 
Variational Autoencoders, MCMC sampleing methods for inference when it is hard to deal with posteriors analytically, 
Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization. The notebooks were completed as assignments for the online course 
"Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning" on Coursera at https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning/
